# Schedule-Your-Days
<h1> Your typical workday scheduler. </h1>
<p> I had fun completing this assignment, also thought to take a step further and create a "clear task" button, <p>
 <p> that allows the user to clear out a task if they were to change their mind. </p>
 <p> I also decided to play with the styling a little bit as well. </p>
